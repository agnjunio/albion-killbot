# albion-killbot

Discord bot to display kill statistics in Albion Online.

It keeps tracks of events using the gameinfo API and displays tracked events for specific players, guilds or entire alliances. For now, we only track kill events in the open world.

Also, when you are tracking a guild, the bot will display the monthly ranking every day at 12pm (bot time).

Other feature suggestions are welcome in the issues section of the github. Please join our Discord server for further questions: https://discord.gg/56AExWh

# How to install

> Since we are quite overloaded, the Free Version of the bot isn't accepting new tracking queries. If you wish to join our Premium server, please contact us in the Discord server.

# Usage

Make sure the bot have the following permissions:

- Read Texts
- Send Messages
- Embed Links

> For detailed information about the commands available. Please check our [Command List](https://github.com/agnjunio/albion-killbot/wiki/Command-List) page on wiki.
> Also, in Discord type `!help` to see the commands available.

First, you need to set up the notification channel using `!channel #channel` command.

```
!channel #killboard
```

If you want to send your notifications to different channels, simply set their categories manually.

Categories are:

- **general**: Any message not related to other categories. Default category.
- **events**: Kills and Deaths of tracked entities.
- **battles**: Battles between guilds and alliances.
- **rankings**: Monthly guild rankings and Daily PvP rankings.

```
!channel #killboard events
!channel #rankings rankings
!channel #battles battles
!channel #announcements general
```

The bot can track players and guilds. Alliances are disabled for now to avoid bot spam. Examples:

If you want to track a guild:

```
!track guild Blue Army
!track guild Black River
```

If you want to track a player:

```
!track player Anjek
!track player MyPlayer
```

To list what guilds/players you're currently tracking, type `!list`
To stop tracking there guilds/players, just swap `!track` for `!untrack`
