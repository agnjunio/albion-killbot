# albion-killbot

Discord bot to display kill statistics in Albion Online.

It keeps tracks of events using the gameinfo API and displays tracked events for specific players, guilds or entire alliances. For now, we only track kill events in the open world.

Also, when you are tracking a guild, the bot will display the monthly ranking every day at 12pm (bot time).

Other feature suggestions are welcome in the issues section of the github.
